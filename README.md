Remotely scans for the existence of the Skeleton Key Malware (http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/skeleton-key-malware-analysis/)

The script works as follows:

Verifies whether the Domain Functional Level (DFL) of current domain supports AES (>= 2008)
Finds an AES supporting client account (msds-supportedencryptiontypes >= 8)
Sends a Kerberos AS-REQ to all DCs with only AES E-type supported (Using python code based on PyKek https://github.com/bidord/pykek, see PyKek-original-README.md)
If AS-REQ fails due to AES encryption not supported, then thereâ€™s a good chance the DC is infected
 

Prerequisites: Python 2.7 needs to be installed

Usage: powershell ./AoratoSkeletonScan.ps1
